            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Demonſtration that Farthings are as neceſſary as Bread, for moſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And that Farthings of an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick value, are uſeleſs, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He number of thoſe whoſe bowels yearn for their dayly bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can earn a penny to buy it, do eminently exceed all the reſt of the people in any Nation; and their extream poverty makes them uncapable of paying, if truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; So that to keep them from Farthings, and ſuch ſmall exchanges, were to ſtarve three quarters of the people, and withal to break, and ſo in fine, to ſtarve all theſe multitude of petty Retailers, who ſells onely theſe poor all neceſſaries for life.</p>
            <p>This neceſſity enforceth thoſe Retailors, for want of a publique allowed Token, to make Tokens of Pence, Half-Pence, and Farthings, and therein, as in all elſe, to grind the faces of the poor, by wholly refuſing, or at beſt, giving but what they pleaſe, for their own late vented Tokens.</p>
            <p>This unreſiſtable want of ſmall exchanges, is yet cleerer by the general acceptance of the Rump two pences, <hi>Dutch</hi> Stivers, and <hi>French</hi> Souces.</p>
            <p>Theſe experiences, together with the obſerved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102866:2"/>waſte of Bulloin by loſs of ſmall Coyn, hath ever produced Copper or Braſs Tokens in all Nations for the neceſſary traffick and ſubſiſtance of the needy, chuſing rather to endure the miſcheif of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, then the dying groans of their ſtarved poor.</p>
            <p>Tokens therefore being as neceſſary as Bread, it is the ſame charity to provide that ſilver be repayed for all Tokens, as that a penny loaf ſhall weigh ſo many Ounces, without which care the poor would quickly be forced to give a penny for one ounce of bread, as now they do ten pence to ſome chandlers of their own Farthings for a two-penny loaf.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Slingsby</hi> of the Mint, to accomodate the poor, and prevent counterfeits, propoſeth a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an intrinſick worth; but conſiders not that if he juſtly performe it, their burthen will be ſo intollerable, that the Chandlor will not ſell his ware for them, becauſe in one week he will have a Cart load of them, and withal, will not know how to get ſilver for them, without which he breaks, becauſe though he ſells by Farthing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, yet be buyeth by pounds and ſhillings.</p>
            <p>Next, though Mr. <hi>Slingsby</hi> be ſtill of ſo publique a Spirit, to give his pains for no gains, yet the people, who have ſo lately been ſo cheated by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to this publique ſpirit, may reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſure ſecurity, that he, and all under, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, ſhall never leſſen his waight, embaſe his Mettal, or refuſe to return ſilver for his Tokens, without loſs of time or money to the people, and that he will alſo take all Counterfeits that ſhall deceive them, under colour of his.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102866:2"/>
            <p>Yet if he would undertake to ſecure all this, which no ſecurity can, until he can afford Copper and labour as cheap as the <hi>Sweads,</hi> and withal bind both <hi>Sweads</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> from ſending us in lighter and courſer Copper Farthings, which cannot be diſcerned, without a Touch-ſtone, and Gold weights in every Family, if theſe impoſſibilities could be ſecured, yet the King loſeth the Noble in the pound which Sir <hi>Edward Ford</hi> offereth, with certain ſecurity and clear evidence that he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all. And yet deſires no Monopoly of Tokens, but that all, who will ſo ſecure the people from all damage, and pay the Noble, as he offereth, may alſo make Tokens, ſo they uſe not his Invention, which the Law gives him for fourteen years, and the King he doubts not, will allow him.</p>
